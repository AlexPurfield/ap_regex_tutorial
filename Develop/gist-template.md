# RegEx Tutorial: Matching a URL

The following tutorial will breakdown a regular expression that is used for matching and verifying URLs. A regular expression or regex, is a series of characters that define a search pattern. They allow you to describe, match, or parse through text. With this URL matching regex we will verify a url matches a certain format.

## Summary

```/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/```
The regex above is used for matching and verifying URLs. I will be breaking down the various regex components such as the anchors, quantifiers, OR operators, character classes, and flags in this expression.

## Regex Components
Between the two ways to create a regex object, literal notation and constructor function notation, the Matching URL regex is in literal notation- meaning the pattern is wrapped in slashes (/). The
